# HIV Risk Predictive Model among Adolescent Girls and Young Women(AGYW) in Kenya

# 1.0 Overview

According to HIV & AIDS world outlook reports highlights HIV as the biggest global health issue with approximately 38 million infected worldwide(WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2020)).The disease mostly affects adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), who are at a higher risk of HIV infection due to a combination of biological, socio-economic, and behavioral factors (WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2019)).

Regionally, sub-Saharan Africa is bearing the bulk of the epidemic and bears nearly 70% of the world's HIV cases (WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2019)).

Locally in Kenya, HIV remains a significant public health issue among AGYW relative to their counterparts who are male. Structural impediments such as gender disparities, levels of poverty, and limited access to education and health care leave AGYW in some of the counties vulnerable to increased vulnerability (National AIDS Control Council, 2020; Ministry of Health Kenya, 2021). Despite interventions such as the Aid-Funded programs that seek to stem HIV infections by surmounting these structural drivers, the challenge of reaching high-risk groups and utilizing existing resources to the fullest for intervention still exists.This research will, therefore adopt Cross Industry Standard Procedures- Data Mining(CRISP-DM) methodology for the health industry.
