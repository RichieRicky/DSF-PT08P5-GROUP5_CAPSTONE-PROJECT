    "\n",
    "According to HIV & AIDS world outlook reports highlights HIV as the biggest global health issue with approximately 38 million infected worldwide(WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2020)).The disease mostly affects adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), who are at a higher risk of HIV infection due to a combination of biological, socio-economic, and behavioral factors (WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2019)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regionally, sub-Saharan Africa is bearing the bulk of the epidemic and bears nearly 70% of the world's HIV cases (WHO(2020), UNAIDS(2019)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally in Kenya, HIV remains a significant public health issue among AGYW relative to their counterparts who are male. Structural impediments such as gender disparities, levels of poverty, and limited access to education and health care leave AGYW in some of the counties vulnerable to increased vulnerability (National AIDS Control Council, 2020; Ministry of Health Kenya, 2021). Despite interventions such as the Aid-Funded programs that seek to stem HIV infections by surmounting these structural drivers, the challenge of reaching high-risk groups and utilizing existing resources to the fullest for intervention still exists.This research will, therefore adopt Cross Industry Standard Procedures- Data Mining(CRISP-DM) methodology for the health industry.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 2.0 Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Health risks like the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is still a major public health problem among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Kenya. AGYW still carry an unbalanced burden of HIV despite the universal national and global campaigns, including the DREAMS program (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, and Safe). AGYW have a greater risk of HIV infection than their male counterparts because of a mix of biological, socio-economic, and behavioral determinants(WHO(2020); https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescents-health-risks-and-solutions, UNAIDS(2019); https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2019-global-AIDS-update_en.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, counties vary in their socio-economic, cultural, and health environments. These are the determinants of HIV vulnerability, access to care, and success of interventions. Even with focused interventions, identifying those most vulnerable and effectively allocating resources to prevent infections is a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of this project is to establish a predictive model to assess HIV risk among AGYW based collected data from select counties. This model, data first problem, will identify individuals who are most at risk of acquiring HIV. The final model will help stakeholders to scale up to cover more counties, channel interventions more effectively and allocate funds more appropriately to those most at risk so that new HIV infection cases can be minimized in these societies."
